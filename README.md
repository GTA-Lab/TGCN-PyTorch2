# T-GCN Implementation in PyTorch 2.x

This repository provides a **PyTorch 2.x** implementation of the **Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (T-GCN)** model, originally proposed in the paper:  
**[T-GCN: A Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Traffic Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05320)**.  

The original implementation was based on **PyTorch Lightning** and can be found here:  
[https://github.com/martinwhl/T-GCN-PyTorch](https://github.com/martinwhl/T-GCN-PyTorch).  

This repository contains an updated version of the code, migrated to **PyTorch 2.x**, with improvements for better compatibility, performance, and ease of use.

## Introduction
T-GCN is a deep learning model designed for traffic prediction, combining **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)** and **Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)** to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies in traffic data. This implementation provides a PyTorch 2.x version of the original model, leveraging the latest features and optimizations in PyTorch.

---

## Requirements
To run the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch 2.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Torchmetrics (>= 0.11)

You can install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Dataset
The model is trained and evaluated on traffic datasets, which typically include traffic speed or flow data. The dataset used in the original paper are included in the `data/` folder.

---

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GTA-Lab/TGCN-PyTorch2.git
   cd TGCN-PyTorch2
   ```
2. Use CLI with YAML config file such as:

    ```bash
    # T-GCN
    python  main.py --config configs/tgcn.yaml --log_path train.log 
    ```

or run main.ipynb
